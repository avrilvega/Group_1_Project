# Group_1_Project
This repository contains our Final Project for Intro to Python course DAB111-24W. 

The codes in this repository stores data into a database using `sqlite3` package and will be served in a website with the use of flask.

## Project Overview
In this project, our goal is to serve Customer Data via a website. To accomplish this, we utilize various technologies and files:

**database.ipynb**: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for creating the database.
**app.py**: This Python file is the core of our project, handling queries and serving data using Flask, along with libraries such as `sqlite3`, `pandas`, and `pathlib`.
**data_table.html**: This HTML file specifies the structure and content of the data that will be displayed on the website.
**about.html**: Here, you'll find the code for the "About" page, which provides information about the dataset, including its source and the definition of each variable.
**index_links.html**: This HTML file defines the structure of the "Home" page, which contains hyperlinks leading to either the About page or the Data page.

## How to Use
To get started with our project, follow these steps:

Run database.ipynb to create the necessary database.
Execute app.py to launch the Flask server.
Visit the website to explore the Customer Data and learn more about the dataset.
